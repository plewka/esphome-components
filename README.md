# esphome-components

esphome 
This is the esphome / home assistant integration in form of a custom
component to support 
* DS2482-100 and DS2482-800 
    One-Wire I2C-controllers done by Maxim/Analog Devices.
* TCA6408A
    I2C Port-Expander derived from esphome projects "PCA9557" with minor adaption

It uses all the fixes from many contributors over the years to get it work.
Check subsequent copyrights intensively if you want to use it.

I'm not ready with the cleanup - only happy it now finally works for me.

# Warning
This is _not_ fully working. Something unfortunately wents wrong at about 
10 sensors. Looks like illegal occupation of memory.
